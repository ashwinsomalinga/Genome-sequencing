#The string_spelled_by_gapped_patterns function takes three arguments: k, d, and patterns. It follows these steps:

Extracts the prefixes and suffixes from the input patterns.
Reconstructs the prefix and suffix strings by calling the reconstruct_string_from_patterns helper function for both prefixes and suffixes.
Checks if a string spelled by the gapped patterns exists by comparing the characters in the appropriate positions.
If a valid string exists, concatenates the prefix and suffix strings, including the overlapping part at the end.
Returns the resulting string.
The reconstruct_string_from_patterns helper function takes a list of patterns and reconstructs a string by appending the last character of each pattern to the previous reconstructed string.

In the example, the input values are provided, and the result is printed, which will be the output string if it exists or a message indicating that no string spelled by the gapped patterns exists.
